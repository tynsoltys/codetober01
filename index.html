	<h1>Codetober 2016</h1>
	<h3>At Least I'm Gonna Try</h3>
	<p>This is pretty much a project about remembering how to use github and using CSS variables (even though I think they are kinda poop), but I'm pretty sure that still counts toward <a href="http://codetober.com">codetober</a> so that's great.</p>
	<p>Let's talk about that though. It seems kind of mega backwards. For example, one would think that the appearance of <em>var</em> would imply a declaration. Wrong. It's actually the var call. So backwards.</p>
